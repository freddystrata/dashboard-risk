# Risk Management Dashboard - Demo Guide

## üéØ Phase 1 Complete - Working Features

### ‚úÖ What's Working Now

1. **Risk Assessment Engine**
   - Automated Probability √ó Impact scoring
   - 6-tier risk level classification 
   - Residual risk calculation with mitigation effectiveness

2. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Summary cards showing total risks and distributions
   - Color-coded risk level indicators
   - High-priority risk alerts
   - Visual distribution charts

3. **Risk Table**
   - Sortable columns (click headers)
   - Filtering by risk level, status, and category
   - Color-coded risk levels and status indicators
   - Responsive design

4. **Sample Data**
   - 7 realistic risk scenarios
   - Multiple categories: Cybersecurity, Operations, HR, Compliance, Technology, Market, Legal
   - Various risk levels and mitigation states

## üöÄ Quick Demo Steps

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd risk-dashboard
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

### 2. Explore the Dashboard Summary
- View the total risk count
- Check risk distribution by level (color-coded cards)
- Observe status distribution (Open, In Progress, Mitigated, Closed)
- Notice the high-priority alert system
- View the visual risk distribution bar

### 3. Test the Risk Table
- Switch to "Risk Table" tab
- **Sort**: Click column headers to sort by different fields
- **Filter**: Use dropdown filters for Risk Level, Status, Category
- **Clear**: Reset all filters with "Clear Filters" button
- **Observe**: Color-coded risk levels and status badges

### 4. Sample Risk Analysis
Look at these example risks in the table:

**High Priority**:
- "Regulatory compliance failure" (Score: 45, HIGHEST level)
- "Data breach due to weak authentication" (Score: 48, HIGHEST level)

**Medium Priority**:
- "Supply chain disruption" (Score: 28, MEDIUM HIGH)
- "Market downturn affecting demand" (Score: 35, MEDIUM HIGH)

**Low Priority**:
- "Software license compliance" (Score: 3, LOW)

### 5. Understand the Scoring System
Each risk shows:
- **Probability** (1-9): Likelihood of occurrence
- **Impact** (1-9): Severity if it occurs  
- **Score**: Probability √ó Impact
- **Risk Level**: Automatically determined from score
- **Residual Score**: After mitigation effectiveness
- **Residual Level**: Post-mitigation risk level

## üßÆ Example Calculations

**Data Breach Risk**:
- Probability: 6, Impact: 8
- Score: 6 √ó 8 = 48 (HIGHEST)
- Mitigation: 30% effective
- Residual: 48 √ó (1 - 0.3) = 33.6 (HIGHEST)

**License Compliance**:
- Probability: 1, Impact: 3  
- Score: 1 √ó 3 = 3 (LOW)
- Mitigation: 90% effective
- Residual: 3 √ó (1 - 0.9) = 0.3 (LOWEST)

## üé® Visual Features

### Color Coding
- **HIGHEST**: Red (requires immediate attention)
- **MEDIUM HIGH**: Dark Orange (high priority)
- **MEDIUM LOW**: Orange (moderate priority)
- **LOW**: Yellow (low priority)
- **VERY LOW**: Light Green (minimal concern)
- **LOWEST**: Green (no concern)

### Status Indicators
- **Open**: Red badge (needs action)
- **In Progress**: Yellow badge (being addressed)
- **Mitigated**: Blue badge (controls in place)
- **Closed**: Green badge (resolved)

## üß™ Test the Core Logic

Run the unit tests to see the calculation engine:
```bash
npm test
```

This validates:
- Risk score calculations
- Level determination logic
- Residual risk calculations
- Input validation
- Edge cases

## üîç Technical Highlights

### Performance
- Client-side processing (no server required)
- Efficient sorting and filtering
- Responsive design
- Type-safe calculations

### Architecture
- Modular component structure
- Separation of concerns (types, utils, components)
- Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- Jest testing for business logic

### Security
- No external API dependencies
- No third-party keys required
- Local data processing
- Input validation built-in

## üìä Business Value Demonstrated

1. **Risk Visibility**: Clear overview of organizational risk landscape
2. **Prioritization**: Automated scoring helps focus on high-impact risks
3. **Mitigation Tracking**: Residual risk calculation shows control effectiveness
4. **Reporting**: Visual dashboards for stakeholder communication
5. **Efficiency**: Automated calculations reduce manual effort

## üö¶ Ready for Phase 2

Phase 1 provides a solid foundation. Next phases will add:
- Excel/CSV import for bulk data loading
- Risk editing forms for data management
- Data persistence for permanent storage
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
